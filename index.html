    <h2>About me:</h2>
    <p>My name is Vishaal Nair, I am a student attending BCIT. I am currently enrolled in the 
     CIT program and have nothing but good words to say about it. I am <em>very</em> 
     interested in computers. I am super excited about how strong my knowledge will be after
     only attending this program for <strong>two years.</strong>
